LTE Reed Muller encoding and decoding
=====================================

The Modified Reed Muller codes (32, O) and (24, A) are used for ACK, CQI transmissions in LTE.
Their encoding and decoding algorithms are included here.

To run the demonstrations under matlab, please enter the below commands, 
  * test_Reed_Muller
  * test_pucch_20_A

The codes follow the MIT license.
